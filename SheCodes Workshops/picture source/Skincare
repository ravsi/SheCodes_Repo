Vitamin c - anti oxidant - brightens skin, boosts collagen production
    1. L-ascorbic acid (L-AA)(pure form of vitamin c), highly unstable, irritates skin, doesnâ€™t agree with all skin types, expensive
    2. 10-20% L-ascorbic acid in vit c is ideal (10-15 for beginner , 20 advanced)
    3. Good brands mention the L-aa % in the lable
    4. C E ferulic acid by skinceuticals - expensive
    5. For beginners: other stable formulae - (ethyl ascorbic acid, AA, AA+Phospate, AA+Sodium)
    6. AA should be in 2/3/4th ingredient ideally
